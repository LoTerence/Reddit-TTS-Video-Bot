                Like the title says, post your picks for 2020 that you will hold til 2030. <br><br>Let's rewind to December of 2009. FB is not yet public. TWTR's tweets are still petite and the stock is unlisted. GOOG is back at $300 for the first time since its pre-recession peak. AAPL is also nearly back at $30, returning to pre-recession highs. MSFT is also at $30, where it has been stagnant since falling after its monopoly-esque problems. <br><br>Fast forward to 2019. FB is at $200. TWTR is now listed and at $30, down from its IPO and recent highs near $45. GOOG is now at $1345. AAPL is $280. And MSFT is $151. Hot damn. Had you been holding since 12/2009, you would have made quite a return on any of these giants.<br><br>Internet consumption tripled from 50 minutes to 157 minutes from 2009 to 2019. TV dropped from 187 minutes to 163. <br><br>But this major shift is IMO what is driving the internet boom. <br><br>So what does this mean for 2030? What stocks should we pick now for 4-10X return in 10 years? <br><br>I think the trend from 2009-2019 will continue through to 2029 even if the relative gains of internet consumption decrease. There is still XX time elsewhere to cannibalize, on TOP of 163 minutes of daily TV time. <br><br>That internet time consumed by average person has tripled, and that the companies that benefit from this have more than tripled, belies the importance of media consumption and the tech revolution as we look forward to 2029. So to that end, what will still be around in 2029, what will be more consumed, what will be more profitable, and what will people be DOING more than today?<br><br>I think the 107 minute per day gain in media is going to hold over the next ten years re: internet use. As people have more free time in general due to the proliferation of the gig economy (tech insecurity = semi-unemployment / gig economy = media use in off time, besides increasing media use in general), FB, TWTR, GOOG are only going to become more engrained into society's everyday functioning. <br><br>I am currently long on FB, and I think TWTR will be the next addition due to its recent drop. TWTR was tracking FB nicely post-2018 correction, and I believe the current price offers an entry target that is substantially undervalued. <br><br>I see 2020 offering a major boon to both companies as election attention ramps up. TWTR will be a bigger name than ever this cycle as it plays out on the internet vs. TV more than any previous cycle (a trend that will only continue in 2024 and 2028). While concerns about FB's reach exist, I do not think they will result in a break-up as long as TWTR survives, as it removes the claims of monopoly. So TWTR's survival is actually also in FB's interest and as it survives it will only become more ubiquitous now that it is profitable. <br><br>I think MSFT and AAPL and GOOG are probably great bets for 2029 as well, but I love FB and TWTR's potential over the next 10 years and would argue FB in particular could be like AAPL around 2009 in terms of impending growth. TWTR could be more of a GOOG. But both offer major return potential. <br><br>Looking ten years ahead, what are your picks, why are the above picks wrong, ETC? :)<br><br>I also like ADBE ($37 in 12/2019 to $303 today), Cloudflare aka NET (IPO @$18, waiting til lockup to consider buying but I love it), OHI (Omega Healthcare, $19 in 09 to $42 today with big dividend), and maybe UBER next year.
            <!--     that scary, but one time i was on a park bench just killing time. This homeless dude that everyone
                called "red" was at another bench. He came up to mine, and asked if i would watch his shit while he
                slept for a bit, and i said yes. So he layed down next to me, and after awhile he sat up for a
                cigarette.
                About 3 drags in, he starts coughing and his face turned all purple FAST. Never realized how fast
                people turn purple
                from lack of oxygen. He fell over on his side, and i jumped up and gave him a little smack -->
