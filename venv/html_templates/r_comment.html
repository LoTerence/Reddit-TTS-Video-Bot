                I was working in a mountain town and couldnt afford rent, even with 2 jobs. <br>One night I was wasted after work, Me and a work friend were always there by ourselves closing so the bar was free game.<br>Left work at 2am walked the hour and a half back to my tent outside of town. While being stalked by a mountain lion, I assume I looked injured and could be an easy meal. It was terrifying. I had a digital camera with me so I just kept pointing it in the area of the ridge where I could hear it walking and flashed repeatedly. Made it home safe.<br><br>Another night after closing, different campsite I mustve smelled like a huge gyro after working a double at Pitas In Paradise. Got into my sleeping bag in my tent. I was just about to doze off when I heard big crunches of a black bear sniffing me out. <br>I was frozen with terror. The bear put his about against the nylon inches above my head. Hot steam on my face. I had pulled the sleeping bag up to my cheeks petrified when I slapped the bears nose above my forehead. It was an involuntary reaction and I felt stupid but I spooked the bear and it took off. <br>I got an apartment with some friends soon after.
