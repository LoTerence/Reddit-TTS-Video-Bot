                called "red" was at another bench. He came up to mine, and asked if i would watch his shit while he
                slept for a bit, and i said yes. So he layed down next to me, and after awhile he sat up for a
                cigarette.
                About 3 drags in, he starts coughing and his face turned all purple FAST. Never realized how fast
                people turn purple
                from lack of oxygen. He fell over on his side, and i jumped up and gave him a little smack -->
